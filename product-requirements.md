# App Name (one-line idea)

BrandLab OS – Avatar-based ad engine for high-context marketing

## Goal in 1 sentence (the "elevator pitch")

A modular platform where we define customer avatars once, then generate and iteratively improve ads (copy + images) across channels using those avatars as the central source of truth.

## Who is it for? (1 sentence)

Performance and creative teams who already think in avatars, JTBD, and angles, and want a system that turns that thinking into consistent, testable ad assets.

## Core features (3–6 bullet points only — no fluff)

* Centralized avatar database with deep JTBD, Four Forces, awareness, sophistication, and identity fields.
* Product workspaces that store pitch, mechanism, claims boundaries, proof, and brand voice per product.
* Ad generation engine that uses avatars + product context to create structured concepts (copy + image briefs/prompts).
* Inline editing: select any text in a script/ad → send a rewrite request with full context (avatar + product + prior copy rules).
* Prompt management system with versioned blocks (global rules, product rules, feature templates) shared across features.
* Feature modules (e.g., static organic ads, scripts, landing pages) that all plug into the same avatars + prompt stack.

## Example user flow (3–5 steps)

1. I pick a product workspace and either create or select existing avatars that reflect my real customers.
2. I open a feature (e.g., Static Organic Ads) and ask for new concepts; the system auto-generates multiple ad variations using avatar context + product positioning.
3. I review generated ads, select promising concepts, and use inline editing to refine copy by highlighting text and requesting rewrites with specific context.
4. I iterate on the best performers, with the system learning from my edits to improve future generations.
5. I export final ads to my preferred platforms or save them as templates for future campaigns.
